### Notes
A few challenges I faced trying to set up the Glide library in Android Studios and trying to render the book images to the RecyclerView. I have limited experience with Android Studios so I had some trouble trying to import the Glide libray into the program and trying to configure the modules so my android emulator would run without any errors. I was able to solve this problem by referencing the Glide instructions and just tickering around with the modules and 'dependencies' until I was able to get it. The second problem I was faced was not being able to get my book images to render in the application when running the emulator. This problem was linked to my intial problem because I did not add the dependencies necessary to be able to execute Glide. 

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids
